This is a simple app based on the Steam api that will pull a user's friends list, and suggest games that both of you own.

To run this service, it is recommended that you use virtualenv.

From the root of the project, run

pip install -r requirements.txt
wheel install lxml-3.4.2-cp27-none-win32.whl
